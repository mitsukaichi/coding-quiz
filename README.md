# coding-quiz

## About this project
This project was done as the forth assignment of a UC Berkeley Full Stack web developer coding bootcamp to learn Javascript.

I developed a webpage that meets the following criteria:
- When user clicks the start button,  a timer starts and the user is presented with a question
- When user answers a question, user is presented with another question
- When a user answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over and user can save my initials and my score

## What I learnt from this project 

### Pseudo-coding is better when you go through all the details than going through the high level idea.
